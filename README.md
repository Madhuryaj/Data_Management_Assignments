Business Problem Statement:
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
An insurance company is facing challenges in effectively analyzing customer characteristics across various insurance products and preferred marketing channels. Currently, the company's data is dispersed across multiple files, hindering efficient analysis and strategic planning efforts. Although the analysts have expertise in SQL, there's a forthcoming transition to R for data analytics.

The primary concern is to establish a solution that seamlessly integrates SQL and R to manage the data efficiently, facilitating secure storage, easy access, and manipulation for analytical purposes. This solution must involve the creation of a concise database structure and documentation of data processing steps to support future analytics tasks.

The overarching goal is to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and interactions with different insurance products and marketing channels. By addressing these challenges, the insurance company aims to enhance strategic decision-making, optimize marketing strategies, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction and retention rates.

1. Data Preparation:
   In this initial phase, all provided data files are gathered and imported into Microsoft Access. The utmost importance is placed on ensuring data integrity and accuracy throughout the import process, laying a solid foundation for subsequent analysis.

2. Database Creation and Integration:
   Using SQL, the imported tables are joined together within Microsoft Access to create an analytics base table. Careful consideration is given to selecting appropriate key fields for seamless integration, facilitating a comprehensive view of the data.

3. Initial Descriptive Analysis:
   Employing SQL queries, an initial descriptive analysis is conducted on the analytics base table. This analysis aims to elucidate customer characteristics across various insurance products and marketing channels, extracting key insights to inform further decision-making.

4. Data Import and Integration in R:
   The raw data files are imported into the R environment, where the 'dplyr' package is utilized to merge datasets and form an analytics base table. This step ensures compatibility with R for subsequent analysis and allows for flexibility in data manipulation.

5. Data Quality Assessment in R:
   A thorough data quality assessment is carried out in R to identify any anomalies or inconsistencies within the dataset. By scrutinizing the data at a granular level, potential issues such as missing values or outliers are uncovered for further investigation.

6. Data Quality Improvement:
   Any identified data quality issues are addressed using appropriate tools, whether through SQL or R. This proactive approach ensures that the dataset is cleansed of inaccuracies, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of subsequent analyses.

7. Documentation:
   Comprehensive documentation is prepared, detailing the database structure, table summaries, join procedures, and a thorough data quality report. This documentation serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders, providing transparency and reproducibility in the analysis process.

8. Detailed Analysis for Insights:
   Leveraging both SQL and R, a detailed analysis is conducted to uncover nuanced insights into customer characteristics across insurance products and marketing channels. The findings from this analysis are synthesized into actionable recommendations to drive strategic planning and marketing efforts.

By systematically addressing each of these steps, the consultant can effectively tackle the business problem at hand, delivering valuable insights that empower the insurance company to make informed decisions and drive business growth.
